## üåü Introduction to Hash Tables

A **hash table** is a data structure that provides fast and efficient data retrieval by mapping keys to values using a hash function. Hash tables are widely used in various applications where quick data lookup, insertion, and deletion are critical, such as in databases, caching, and associative arrays.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Fast Data Access**: Hash tables provide average-case O(1) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion.
- **Key-Value Mapping**: Data is stored as key-value pairs, where each key is unique.
- **Hashing**: A hash function is used to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## üîß How Hash Tables Work

A hash table uses a **hash function** to compute an index into an array (often called a bucket array) of slots, from which the desired value can be retrieved.

### Basic Process:
1. **Key Hashing**: The key is passed through a hash function to produce a hash code (an integer).
2. **Index Calculation**: The hash code is then mapped to an index within the bounds of the array.
3. **Storage**: The value associated with the key is stored at the calculated index.
4. **Collision Handling**: If two keys hash to the same index, a collision occurs, and a collision resolution strategy is used.

## üîë Hash Functions

A **hash function** converts a given key into a hash code, an integer value that determines the index in the array. A good hash function distributes keys uniformly across the array to minimize collisions.

### Characteristics of a Good Hash Function:
- **Deterministic**: The same key should always produce the same hash code.
- **Uniform Distribution**: Hash codes should be evenly distributed to avoid clustering.
- **Efficient Computation**: The hash function should be quick to compute.
- **Minimizes Collisions**: Although collisions are inevitable, a good hash function reduces their likelihood.

## üöß Handling Collisions

Collisions occur when two keys produce the same hash code and, consequently, the same array index. There are several strategies to handle collisions:

### 1. Chaining

In chaining, each array index points to a linked list (or another data structure) that contains all the key-value pairs that hash to the same index.

#### Example:
```java
import java.util.LinkedList;

class HashTableChaining {
    private LinkedList<Entry>[] bucketArray;
    private int numBuckets;

    class Entry {
        String key;
        int value;

        Entry(String key, int value) {
            this.key = key;
            this.value = value;
        }
    }

    public HashTableChaining(int size) {
        numBuckets = size;
        bucketArray = new LinkedList[numBuckets];

        for (int i = 0; i < numBuckets; i++) {
            bucketArray[i] = new LinkedList<>();
        }
    }

    private int getBucketIndex(String key) {
        int hashCode = key.hashCode();
        return Math.abs(hashCode % numBuckets);
    }

    public void put(String key, int value) {
        int bucketIndex = getBucketIndex(key);
        LinkedList<Entry> bucket = bucketArray[bucketIndex];

        for (Entry entry : bucket) {
            if (entry.key.equals(key)) {
                entry.value = value;
                return;
            }
        }

        bucket.add(new Entry(key, value));
    }

    public Integer get(String key) {
        int bucketIndex = getBucketIndex(key);
        LinkedList<Entry> bucket = bucketArray[bucketIndex];

        for (Entry entry : bucket) {
            if (entry.key.equals(key)) {
                return entry.value;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

### 2. Open Addressing

In open addressing, when a collision occurs, the algorithm probes the array for the next empty slot to place the key-value pair. Common techniques include linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing.

#### Example: Linear Probing
```java
class HashTableOpenAddressing {
    private String[] keys;
    private int[] values;
    private int numBuckets;

    public HashTableOpenAddressing(int size) {
        numBuckets = size;
        keys = new String[numBuckets];
        values = new int[numBuckets];
    }

    private int getBucketIndex(String key) {
        int hashCode = key.hashCode();
        return Math.abs(hashCode % numBuckets);
    }

    public void put(String key, int value) {
        int bucketIndex = getBucketIndex(key);

        while (keys[bucketIndex] != null) {
            if (keys[bucketIndex].equals(key)) {
                values[bucketIndex] = value;
                return;
            }
            bucketIndex = (bucketIndex + 1) % numBuckets;
        }

        keys[bucketIndex] = key;
        values[bucketIndex] = value;
    }

    public Integer get(String key) {
        int bucketIndex = getBucketIndex(key);

        while (keys[bucketIndex] != null) {
            if (keys[bucketIndex].equals(key)) {
                return values[bucketIndex];
            }
            bucketIndex = (bucketIndex + 1) % numBuckets;
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Basic Operations on Hash Tables

### ‚ûï Insertion

Insertion involves computing the hash code for the key, determining the index, and placing the key-value pair in the appropriate bucket or slot. If a collision occurs, a collision resolution strategy is employed.

### üîç Search

To retrieve a value, the key is hashed, and the resulting index is used to locate the value. The collision resolution strategy used during insertion must be followed to ensure the correct value is retrieved.

### ‚ûñ Deletion

Deletion involves finding the key, as in search, and then removing the key-value pair from the hash table. Special care must be taken to maintain the integrity of the collision resolution strategy.

## üöÄ Implementing a Hash Table in Java

Java provides a robust implementation of hash tables through the `HashMap` class, which uses a combination of chaining and open addressing to handle collisions efficiently.

### Basic Example Using `HashMap`:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class HashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> hashMap = new HashMap<>();

        // Adding key-value pairs
        hashMap.put("Alice", 25);
        hashMap.put("Bob", 30);
        hashMap.put("Charlie", 35);

        // Retrieving values
        System.out.println("Alice's age: " + hashMap.get("Alice")); // Outputs: Alice's age: 25

        // Deleting a key-value pair
        hashMap.remove("Bob");

        // Checking for existence of a key
        if (hashMap.containsKey("Bob")) {
            System.out.println("Bob is in the hash table.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Bob is not in the hash table."); // Outputs: Bob is not in the hash table.
        }
    }
}
```

## üí° Applications of Hash Tables

Hash tables are used in a wide range of applications, including:
- **Caching**: Fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
- **Symbol Tables**: Used in compilers and interpreters to store and retrieve identifiers.
- **Databases**: Indexing for quick lookup of records.
- **Associative Arrays**: Mapping keys to values in programming languages.
- **Counting Frequencies**: Efficiently counting occurrences of elements in a dataset.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Advantages and Disadvantages
